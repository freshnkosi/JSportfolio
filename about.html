    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>I matriculated in 2021 and that's the same year I got interested into Coding.  </p>
    <p>So, I did my research and bumped into 'Code College' on the internet, and that's exactly where my journey started.</p>
    <p>As a beginner in this fast-pace industry. One thing I've realised is that nothing comes easy. But either than all that, what I can say is that it has been a great journey.</p>
    <p>I love keeping my eyes constantly peeled for greater opportunities so that is the reason I chose this path. There are still a lot more things that I still have to learn in coding and I'm looking forward to that.</p>
